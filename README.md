# MessengerAnalysis
Small scripts I made to analyse data from our 5 year convo on Messenger with my friends.

If you request your data from Facebook (Meta) to get your conversations from Messenger, you should get a JSON file, (or several, depending on the lenght of the convo).

The merger.py contains what's needed to merge them and encode them properly (somehow, Meta uses latin-1 instead of utf-8) as well as a function to nuke someone out of a convo, and the tools.py file contains a sample of what's doable to get funny data on group chat with your friends
